This is a modified version of the example solution to The Hut Group 2014 Recommendation Challenge (http://www.thehutchallenge.com)


*** How To Use ***

To run the scripts and generate the recommendations, first download the two data sets from the challenge website.
Place these files (train.csv and customers_to_predict.csv) inside the 'given' directory. From the directory
containing the makefile, invoke the command:

make clean all

This may take a minute or two to execute. Once it's finished, the file overall_output.csv will contain the
final recommendations in the correct format to upload to the challenge website.
